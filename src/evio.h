/**
 * Exception-aware way to add a listening socket to the event
 * loop. Callbacks are invoked on bind and accept events.
 *
 * Coroutines/fibers are not used for port listeners
 * since listener's job is usually simple and only involves
 * creating a session for the accepted socket. The session itself
 * can be built around simple libev callbacks, or around
 * cooperative multitasking (on_accept callback can create
 * a fiber and use coio.h (cooperative multi-tasking I/O)) API.
 *
 * How to use a service:
 * struct evio_service *service;
 * service = malloc(sizeof(struct evio_service));
 * evio_service_init(service, ..., on_accept_cb, ...);
 * evio_service_start(service);
 * ...
 * evio_service_stop(service);
 * free(service);
 *
 * If a service is not started, but only initialized, no
 * dedicated cleanup/destruction is necessary.
