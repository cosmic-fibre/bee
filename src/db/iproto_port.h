/**
 * struct iproto_port users need to be careful to:
 * - not unwind output of other fibers when
 *   rolling back to a savepoint (provided that
 *   multiple fibers work on the same session),
 * - not increment write position before there is a complete
 *   response, i.e. a response which will not be rolled back
 *   and which has a complete header.
 * - never increment write position without having
 *   a complete response. Otherwise a situation can occur
 *   when many requests started processing, but completed
 *   in a different order, and thus incomplete output is
 *   sent to the client.
 *
 * To ensure this, iproto_port must be used only in
 * atomic manner, i.e. once first port_add_tuple() is done,
 * there can be no yields until port_eof().
