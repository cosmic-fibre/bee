/**
 * @module cluster - global state of multi-master
 * replicated database.
 *
 * Right now the cluster can only consist of instances
 * connected with asynchronous master-master replication.
 *
 * Each cluster has a globally unique identifier. Each
 * server in the cluster is identified as well. A server
 * which is part of one cluster can not join another
 * cluster.
 *
 * Cluster and server identifiers are stored in a system
 * space _cluster on all servers. The server identifier
 * is also stored in each snapshot header, this is how
 * the server knows which server id in the _cluster space is
 * its own id.
 *
 * Cluster and server identifiers are globally unique
 * (UUID, universally unique identifiers). In addition
 * to these unique but long identifiers, a short integer id
 * is used for pervasive server identification in a replication
 * stream, a snapshot, or internal data structures.
 * The mapping between 16-byte globally unique id and
 * 4 byte cluster local id is stored in _cluster space. When
 * a server joins the cluster, it sends its globally unique
 * identifier to one of the masters, and gets its cluster
 * local identifier as part of the reply to the JOIN request
 * (in fact, it gets it as a REPLACE request in _cluster
 * system space along with the rest of the replication
 * stream).
 *
 * Cluster state on each server is represented by a table
 * like below:
 *
 *   ----------------------------------
 *  | server id        | confirmed lsn |
 *   ----------------------------------
 *  | 1                |  1258         | <-- changes of the first server
 *   ----------------------------------
 *  | 2                |  1292         | <-- changes of the local server
 *   ----------------------------------
 *
 * This table is called in the code "cluster vector clock".
 * and is implemented in @file vclock.h
