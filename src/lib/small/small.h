/**
 * Small object allocator.
 *
 * The allocator consists of a collection of mempools.
 *
 * There are two containers of pools:
 *
 * pools for objects of size 8-500 bytes are stored in an array,
 * where pool->objsize of each array member is a multiple of 8-16
 * (value defined in STEP_SIZE constant). These are
 * "stepped" pools, since pool->objsize of each next pool in the
 * array differs from the  previous size by a fixed step size.
 *
 * For example, there is a pool for size range 16-32,
 * another one for 32-48, 48-64, etc. This makes the look up
 * procedure for small allocations just a matter of getting an
 * array index via a bit shift. All stepped pools are initialized
 * when an instance of small_alloc is created.
 *
 * Objects of size beyond the stepped pools range (the upper limit
 * is usually around 300 bytes), are stored in pools with a size
 * which is a multiple of alloc_factor. alloc_factor is itself
 * a configuration constant in the range (1.0, 2.0]. I.e. imagine
 * alloc_factor is 1.1, then there are pools for objects of size
 * 300-330, 330-363, and so on. These pools are created upon first
 * allocation within given range, and stored in a red-black tree.
 *
 * Initially this red-black tree contains only a pool for
 * alloc->object_max.
 * When a request for a new allocation of sz bytes arrives
 * and it can not be satisfied from a stepped pool,
 * a search for a nearest factored pool is made in the tree.
 *
 * If, for the nearest found factored pool:
 *
 * pool->objsize > sz * alloc_factor,
 *
 * (i.e. pool object size is too big) a new factored pool is
 * created and inserted into the tree.
 *
 * This way the tree only contains factored pools for sizes
 * which are actually used by the server, and can be kept
 * small.

 * @brief Return an unique index associated with a chunk allocated

 *
 * This index space is more dense than the pointers space,
 * especially in the least significant bits.  This number is
 * needed because some types of db's indexes (e.g. BITSET) have
 * better performance then they operate on sequential offsets
 * (i.e. dense space) instead of memory pointers (sparse space).
 *
 * The calculation is based on SLAB number and the position of an
 * item within it. Current implementation only guarantees that
 * adjacent chunks from one SLAB will have consecutive indexes.
 * That is, if two chunks were sequentially allocated from one
 * chunk they will have sequential ids. If a second chunk was
 * allocated from another SLAB th–µn the difference between indexes
 * may be more than one.
