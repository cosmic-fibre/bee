.. confval:: replication_source

    If ``replication_source`` is not an empty string, the server is considered
    to be a Bee replica. The replica server will try to connect to the
    master which replication_source specifies with a :ref:`URI` (Universal
    Resource Identifier), for example :samp:`{konstantin}:{secret_password}@{bee.org}:{3301}`.

    The default user name is ‘guest’. The ``replication_source`` parameter is
    dynamic, that is, to enter master mode, simply set ``replication_source``
    to an empty string and issue

    .. code-block:: lua

        db.cfg{replication_source=new-value}

    Type: string |br|
    Default: null |br|
    Dynamic: **yes** |br|
