                        Appendix D. Plugins
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

A plugin is an optional library which enhances Bee functionality.

The details of creating one's own plugin are described on the `Bee Plugin API wiki page`_.

The discussion here in the user guide is about incorporating and using two
plugins that have already been created: the "SQL DBMS plugins" for
MySQL and PostgreSQL.

===========================================================
                  SQL DBMS Plugins
===========================================================

To call another DBMS from Bee, the essential requirements are: another
DBMS, and Bee.

It will be necessary to build Bee from source, as described in
“ :ref:`building-from-source` ”

.. _Bee Plugin API wiki page: https://github.com/bee/bee/wiki/Plugin-API

The Bee plugins allow for connecting to an SQL server and executing SQL
statements the same way that a MySQL or PostgreSQL client does. The SQL
statements are visible as Lua methods. Thus Bee can serve as a "MySQL Lua
Connector" or "PostgreSQL Lua Connector", which would be useful even if that was
all Bee could do. But of course Bee is also a DBMS, so the plugin
also is useful for any operations, such as database copying and accelerating,
which work best when the application can work on both SQL and Bee inside
the same Lua routine.

The connection method is
``db.net.sql.connect('mysql'|'pg', host, port, user, password, database)``.
The methods for select/insert/etc. are the same as the ones in the net.db package.

                  MySQL Example
===========================================================

This example assumes that MySQL 5.5 or MySQL 5.6 has been installed (recent
MariaDB versions should also work).

The example was run on a Linux machine where the base directory had a copy of
the Bee source on ~/bee, and a copy of MySQL on ~/mysql-5.5. The
mysqld server is already running on the local host 127.0.0.1.

::

    # Check that the include subdirectory exists by looking for .../include/mysql.h.
    # (If this fails, there's a chance that it's in .../include/mysql/mysql.h instead.)
    $ [ -f ~/mysql-5.5/include/mysql.h ] && echo "OK" || echo "Error"
    OK

    # Check that the library subdirectory exists and has the necessary .so file.
    $ [ -f ~/mysql-5.5/lib/libmysqlclient.so ] && echo "OK" || echo "Error"
    OK

    # Check that the mysql client can connect using some factory defaults:
    # port = 3306, user = 'root', user password = '', database = 'test'.
    # These can be changed, provided one uses the changed values in
    # all places.
    $ ~/mysql-5.5/bin/mysql --port=3306 -h 127.0.0.1 --user=root --password= --database=test

===========================================================
                  PostgreSQL Example
===========================================================

This example assumes that a recent version of PostgreSQL has been installed.
The PostgreSQL library and include files are also necessary. On Ubuntu they
can be installed with

.. code-block:: bash

    $ sudo apt-get install libpq-dev

If that works, then cmake will find the necessary files without requiring any
special user input. However, because not all platforms are alike, for this
example the assumption is that the user must check that the appropriate
PostgreSQL files are present and must explicitly state where they are when
building Bee from source.

The example was run on a Linux machine where the base directory had a copy of
the Bee source on ~/bee, and a copy of PostgreSQL on /usr. The
postgres server is already running on the local host 127.0.0.1.
