/*
 * Find out LuaJIT behavior on the current platform.
 *
 * LuaJIT uses different stack unwinding mechanisms on 32-bit x86
 * and 64-bit x86-64 hardware: on a  32-bit system it can use
 * its own * longjmp-style "internal stack unwinding".
 * Among other things, this mechanism doesn't support exception
 * propagation from Lua panic function (lua_atpanic()), and
 * this is exactly what Bee does: throws an exception
 * in lua_atpanic().
 *
 * Which mechanism to use is determined at library
 * compile time, by a set of flags
 * (-fexceptions -funwind-tables -DLUAJIT_UNWIND_EXTERNAL),
 * hence, when configuring, we can't just check the library file
 * to find out whether or not it will work.
 * Instead, we compile and run this test.
