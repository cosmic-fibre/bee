OS X Readme
===========

This manual explains how to manually build bee from sources.

Supporting kinds of build with default Apple developer software and external as
homebrew as MacPorts.

If you want to build at the Homebrew environment execute:

    brew install https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bee/bee/master/extra/bee.rb --devel

Possible flags are:

    --devel - for installing master's branch version
    --with-tests - for testing bee after building/installing
    --with-debug - for building bee with -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug

Target OS: MacOS X "Lion"

First of all, make sure mac ports are available (to install packages from).

1. Install necessary packages (ports):
-------------

Default build depended by Developer tools by Apple and -DDARWIN_BUILD_TYPE=None:

	sudo xcode-select --install
	sudo xcode-select -switch /Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer

To enable build type with MacPorts set up the flag -DDARWIN_BUILD_TYPE=Ports:

	port install autoconf binutils cmake ncurses zlib readline

2. Upgrade clang to 3.2+
-------------

Go to http://developer.apple.com/ to download and install the latest version
of "Command Line Tools for Xcode". This package contains /usr/bin/clang and
/usr/bin/clang++ binaries. Check that clang version is at least 3.2.

3. Install necessary python modules: pyYAML, python-daemon
-------------
If you use latest Mac OS X version it is recommended using easy_install or pip.
For instance to install these packages via easy_install just type following commands
into terminal:

sudo easy_install pyyaml
sudo easy_install pydaemon
sudo easy_install daemon

Otherwise see following instruction

NB: it is recommended to install python modules through setup.py,
using the default python (which should be >= 2.6.x and < 3.x);

tar -xzf module.tar.gz
cd module-dir
sudo python setup.py install

where module is the name of the installed module and module-dir is the name of
the directory the module's archive deflates into.

4. Download & build bee source code:
-------------

NOTE: If you want to get DMG package go to section 6.

    git clone --recursive git://github.com/bee/bee.git

    cd bee
    mkdir build && cd build
    cmake .. \
        -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=RelWithDebugInfo \
        -DENABLE_CLIENT=true \
        -DDARWIN_BUILD_TYPE=Ports
    make

5. Run bee test suite
-------------
NB: the following tests are not runnable on MacOS X at this point:

db/lua.test
db_big/lua.test
connector_c/xlog_rpl.test

To disable those add each of them to the 'disabled' clause in suite.ini file
in the appropriate directory; for instance, bee/test/db/suite.ini must
be edited to disable any test in the 'db' suite;

To run all tests then, execute:

cd ~/build/bee/test
./run

6. Build DMG package
-------------

Building DMG depended by "Auxiliary Tools for Xcode", which be able to download from:

https://developer.apple.com (necessary login with Apple ID account).

Execute commands to get DMG package by root (if you not root you'll get files with incorrect permissions):

mkdir build && cd build
sudo -s
cmake ..  \
	-DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr/local \
	-DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Rel \
	-DENABLE_BACKTRACE=OFF \
	-DCMAKE_C_COMPILER="clang" \
	-DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER="clang++" \
	-DDARWIN_BUILD_TYPE=None \
	-DENABLE_CLIENT=ON

make package
